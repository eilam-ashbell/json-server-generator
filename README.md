# JSON server generator
JSON server generator is a module that combine the ability to generate random data and to serve it localy. 

You can fined this little module as a good solution for creating mock DB to work with for Q&A, working while backend isn't ready yet, or just to start working without the need of heavy DB.

This module relies on `JSON-server` & `Faker-js`.

## Get Started üöÄ
Clone JSON server generator
```
git clone https://-------
```
Install json-server
```
npm install -g json-server
```
Initiate this project:
```
npm i
```

Open schemas.ts file and define your desired data routes and structure

## What are schemas üßê
Schemas are your way do define your generated data stracture.

Each schema is a typescript class that define 4 things:

1. Route name.
2. Stracture & type of data in each route.
3. How many data objects will be generated for each route.
4. Does the objects needs a default ID number.

Onece you defined your schemas - we will do the rest automatic!

## Writting a schema üìù
To start writting your schemas, open `schemas.ts` file in the `/src` folder. 

As mentioned, schema is just typescript class.

The simplest schema can contain only class decleration and constractor function. In the constractor, you need to define your data fields's names and what value to generate into it.
for example:
```
export class student {
    constructor() {
        this["fName"] = faker.name.firstName()
    }
};
```
This schema will define an object with one key of 'fName' and a generated value of first name:
```
{"fName":"John"}
```

By default, when you generate data for your mockDB, every schema will be generate for 10 instances.
You can adjust the amount of instances by adding `amount` as static propery to your schema.
Let's take our last example:
```
export class student {
    static "amount" = 5;
    constructor() {
        this["fName"] = faker.name.firstName()
    }
};
```
Now we'll recive only 5 instances for this current schema.
```
{
    students: [
        {"fName":"John"},
        {"fName":"Paul"},
        {"fName":"Ringo"},
        {"fName":"Gorge"},
        {"fName":"Bob"}
    ]
}
```
You can define different number of instance to each schema.

Another option you can set in schemas is if you want to add a running id number to all of schemas's instance or not. by default, this option is disabled. If you want to add difaults ids you can add your schema the `defaultId` as static parameter and set it to `true`.
let's check our example again:
```
export class student {
    static "amount" = 5;
    static "defaultId" = true
    constructor() {
        this["fName"] = faker.name.firstName()
    }
};
```
Now, every instance that will be generate will have a key of `id` and runing number (from 0 to 4 in this case) as value. The resault will be like:
```
{
    students: [
        {"fName":"John", "id"=0},
        {"fName":"Paul", "id"=1},
        {"fName":"Ringo", "id"=2},
        {"fName":"Gorge", "id"=3},
        {"fName":"Bob", "id"=4}
    ]
}
```
If you want to disable this option again you can just remove the `amount` property or define it to `false`.


#### Keep in minde:
* You can fill `schemas.ts` in schemas as much as you need.
* Make sure that each schema should be exported.
* Schema's name will automaticly converts to route path name.
* You can nest one schema insite another schema to get more complicated data objects.



    
## Data generation ‚ú®
*JSON server generator* relies on `faker-js` external library to generate data.

This wondefull library is full of data types◊™ options, allows great flexibility and adjustments.

To learn more about data generation options, visit [faker-js documentation](https://fakerjs.dev/api/).

## Serve your mockDB üßë‚Äçüíª
After you defined all your schemas, just open your terminal in the root folder of this project, and run 
```
npm run serve
```
This command automaticly generate your data, save it to `mockDB.json` file and initiate `JSON-server` on port 3000.
once the proccess finished you can see in your terminal all your endpoint for each schema and start using it.

If from some reason you want to run `json-server` on another port, you can run
```
npm start
``` 
to generate your data, and just after it finished run
```
json-server --watch mockDB.json --port xxxx
```
xxxx = your new port.
